# Theme

## Folders and files

A themes shared many of the same common folders and files as a plugin.

At the minimum, WordPress requires a theme to have a file named `style.css` with a comment block as header.

```css
/*
Theme Name: project-title
Theme URI: 
Author: 
Author URI: 
Description: project-description
Version: 0.0.0
License: GNU General Public License v2 or later
License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
Tags: 
Text Domain: project-name
Requires at least: 4.6
Tested up to: 6.6
Requires PHP: 7.4
*/
```

For a child theme:

```css
/*
Template: parent-theme
*/
```
